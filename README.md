# 🌸 Iris Classification App

A simple **Machine Learning project** that demonstrates the process of data analysis, model training, and building an interactive web application with **Streamlit**.  

This project uses the classic **Iris dataset** to classify flower species based on petal and sepal measurements.

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Conducted in Jupyter Notebook.  
   - Explored the dataset with descriptive statistics and visualizations.  
   - Checked class distribution and feature relationships.  

2. **Model Training**  
   - Preprocessing with **StandardScaler**.  
   - Model: **RandomForestClassifier** (scikit-learn).  
   - Combined into a **Pipeline** for reproducibility.  
   - Achieved high accuracy on the test set.  

3. **Model Persistence**  
   - Saved the trained pipeline using **joblib** into the `models/` directory.  

4. **Interactive App**  
   - Built with **Streamlit** in `app.py`.  
   - Users can input flower measurements with sliders.  
   - The app predicts the species and shows class probabilities with a bar chart.
